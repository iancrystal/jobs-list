=JOBBSLIST

This is a simple job posting application created by Ian Crystal for a client from elance.com. 

The source code of this application was documented using rdoc. Open doc/app/index.html for easy viewing of source code and documentation.

Unit, functional and integration tests were written for this application (under the test directory). Run "rake test" to run all tests. 

The application sends job posting and payment confirmation emails to the customer using the gmail_smtp plugin.

The acts_as_tree plugin was used to support a tree structure for the categories. However the current site uses a flat category structure since the client preferred it.

Textile's RedCloth was used for the job description editor.

The Active Merchant/Paypal is used for the payment gateway. 

The Wufoo form framework was used to create some of the forms.

The business strategy of the site was simplicity therefore the user login and admin links are small and located at the footer.
